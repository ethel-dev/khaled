# The only JavaScript library that generates DJ Khaled quotes randomly.

### Usage
You can use Khaled in a number of ways, including but not limited to:

- Through [the website.](http://soops.github.io/khaled)
- In your projects, for whatever reason. Just include the file `khaled.js` in your HTML or just download it via Bower (`bower install khaled`)

If you want to use it in your projects, here is some sample code to get you going:
```javascript
var khaled = KhaledJS() // for now, the function is simple and takes no parameters at all, which will change... a LAHT

// once the function has been run it will return your goodies in an object

console.log(khaled.key) // ex. "The key to success is to get down with Jeezy before he was Jeezy."
console.log(khaled.they) // ex. "They don't want you to have lunch, so what we gon' do is have lunch more."
console.log(khaled.you) // ex. "You smart, they gonna shut the door, so just open it, because you brave."
console.log(khaled.phrase) // ex. "another lion"
```

### Dedication
This library is dedicated to We The Best (duh) and more importantly Ethan and Hila Klein of [h3h3productions](https://www.youtube.com/user/h3h3Productions). They make some really awesome content and have helped me laugh when I feel like giving up. I thank them wholeheartedly for that. If you're reading this, dudes, you're awesome!
